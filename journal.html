    my experiences, and the memories I‚Äôve made along the way. 
    Scroll down to explore different destinations!
  </p>

 
  <h2> Manali</h2>
  <p>
    Manali is one of my favorite hill stations. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains, 
    it‚Äôs a perfect destination for adventure and relaxation. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Best food: Maggi at Rohtang Pass</li>
    <li>Activity: River rafting in Beas River</li>
    <li>Memory: First time seeing heavy snowfall</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Goa</h2>
  <p>
    Goa is all about beaches, sunsets, and nightlife. The vibe here is completely different. 
    Walking barefoot on the sand during sunset is something I will never forget.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Baga Beach for parties</li>
    <li>Chapora Fort for views</li>
    <li>Shacks for delicious seafood</li>
  </ol>

  <h2> Varanasi</h2>
  <p>
    Varanasi is one of the oldest living cities in the world. The Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat 
    is a spiritual experience that stays in your heart forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    The narrow streets, temples, and culture make Varanasi a truly unique city to explore.

  <h2> Delhi</h2>
  <p>
    Delhi is a city of history and culture. From Red Fort to India Gate, 
    every monument tells a story of its own.
