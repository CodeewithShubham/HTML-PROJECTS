  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Shubham Moriya. This is my personal blog where I share my thoughts, 
    experiences, and knowledge about technology, fitness, and personal growth. 
    Scroll down to explore different sections of my blog!
  </p>


  <h2>Technology & Coding</h2>
  <p>
    I started my journey with programming by learning <b>C</b> and <b>C++</b>. 
    Later, I explored <b>Python</b> and <b>SQL</b>. 
    Recently, I have been building projects in <b>HTML</b>, which is the foundation of the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coding has not only improved my problem-solving skills but also given me a creative outlet 
    to build something useful for others.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Fitness Lifestyle</h2>
  <p>
    Apart from coding, fitness is an important part of my life. 
    I have been training consistently for 2 years with the goal of building an aesthetic physique. 
    I follow a 6-day workout split and focus on lean bulking for sustainable growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gym is not just about building muscles; it also teaches discipline, patience, and consistency.
